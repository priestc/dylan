    <p>
        BitTorrent is great for grabbing live shows, but only if there are seeders.
        At Dylan Shows, all shows are available for streaming at all times.

    <p>
        Dylan Shows is build on top of a distributed file hosting platform.
        Anyone can host music that is indexed through this site.
